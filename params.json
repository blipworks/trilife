{"name":"Trilife","body":"### Build a blinking LED wall with Trilife\r\nBuild a bunch of little circuit boards using these design files, then connect them together to see patterns emerge. Included in the download are a pdf with detailed build instructions, the layout and schematic (in Eagle 6.0) for a single board and for an array of boards, a bill of materials, and PIC firmware so you can program the boards. It's designed for a large group to learn how to solder.\r\n\r\n### See Trilife in action\r\n[Here's a video of a small Trilife network ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=ULYILjv6semDM&feature=player_detailpage&v=YILjv6semDM)\r\n","tagline":"Code and design files for Trilife cellular automata blinky LED project","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
